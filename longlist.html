      <p>It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe<br>
      It don't matter, anyhow<br>
      An' it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe<br>
      If you don't know by now<br>
      When your rooster crows at the break of dawn<br>
      Look out your window and I'll be gone<br>
      You're the reason I'm trav'lin' on<br>
      Don't think twice, it's all right</p>
      <p>It ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe<br>
      That light I never knowed<br>
      An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe<br>
      I'm on the dark side of the road<br>
      Still I wish there was somethin' you would do or say<br>
      To try and make me change my mind and stay<br>
      We never did too much talkin' anyway<br>
      So don't think twice, it's all right</p>
      <p>It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal<br>
      Like you never did before<br>
      It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal<br>
      I can't hear you anymore<br>
      I'm a-thinkin' and a-wond'rin' all the way down the road<br>
      I once loved a woman, a child I'm told<br>
      I give her my heart but she wanted my soul<br>
      But don't think twice, it's all right</p>
      <p>I'm walkin' down that long, lonesome road, babe<br>
      Where I'm bound, I can't tell<br>
      But goodbye's too good a word, gal<br>
      So I'll just say fare thee well<br>
      I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind<br>
      You could have done better but I don't mind<br>
      You just kinda wasted my precious time<br>
      But don't think twice, it's all right</p>
